# Data Mesh Implementation Workshop

This Jupyter notebook provides a practical demonstration of implementing a data mesh architecture on AWS. It accompanies Chapter 8: Modern Data Architecture Patterns from the book "Data Engineering with AWS."

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the key components of a data mesh architecture:

1. **Domain Data Products**: Creating domain-oriented data products for Customer and Sales domains
2. **Self-Serve Infrastructure**: Implementing templates for domain teams to create their own data products
3. **Federated Governance**: Setting up tag-based governance that spans domains
4. **Cross-Domain Analytics**: Building integrated views that combine data across domain boundaries

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you'll need:

1. **AWS Account**: With permissions to create S3 buckets, Glue databases/tables, and (optionally) Lake Formation resources
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.7+ with the following packages:
   - boto3
   - pandas
   - jupyter/ipython
3. **AWS Credentials**: Configured either through environment variables, AWS CLI, or another method

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install boto3 pandas jupyter
   ```
3. Ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

## Running the Notebook

1. Start Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `data_mesh_implementation.ipynb` file
3. Run the cells in sequence to implement each component of the data mesh

## Workshop Sections

### 1. Creating Domain Data Products

This section creates S3 buckets, Glue databases, and tables for each domain (Customer and Sales), demonstrating how domains own and maintain their data products.

### 2. Implementing Self-Serve Infrastructure

This section creates reusable templates for data product creation, allowing domain teams to deploy standardized infrastructure for new data products.

### 3. Implementing Federated Governance

This section demonstrates how to use Lake Formation tags to implement governance policies that span domains, balancing central control with domain autonomy.

### 4. Implementing Cross-Domain Analytics

This section creates integrated views that span multiple domains, demonstrating how to enable cross-domain analytics while maintaining domain ownership.

## Resource Management

The notebook creates several AWS resources:
- S3 buckets for each domain
- AWS Glue databases and tables
- Cross-domain analytics database and views

**Important**: To avoid unnecessary charges, run the cleanup cell at the end of the notebook when you're finished with the workshop. This will remove all resources created during the workshop.

## Expected Output

When running the notebook, you'll see:
- Success messages for each created resource
- SQL examples for cross-domain views
- Sample query results
- A diagram of the federated governance model

## Adapting for Production

This notebook provides a simplified implementation for educational purposes. For a production implementation, consider:

1. Adding proper error handling and retry logic
2. Implementing more robust security measures
3. Setting up monitoring and alerting
4. Creating a more comprehensive self-serve platform
5. Implementing automated data quality checks
